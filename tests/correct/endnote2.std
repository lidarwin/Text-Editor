   Here, we make sure that we can change formatting in endnotes[1]. This

   That goes  also for the next  paragraph, which should continue  to be
set at the default width.

[1] These   lines
    should  be  only
    20   characters
    wide,   without
    changing   the
    formatting   of
    regular text.
